1) - What type of coding language is c++?
a) - procedural
b) - object oriented
c) - functional
d) - scripting
Ans- a

Problem statement
2) What is a sparse graph?
Options: Pick one correct answer from below

A graph with many edges

Few edges relative to vertices

All vertices fully connected

A graph with self-loops
Solution description
A sparse graph is a type of graph in which there are relatively few edges compared to the total number of vertices. In other words, it is a graph where the edge density is low. In a sparse graph, most pairs of vertices are not directly connected by an edge.

3)Problem statement
What is the time complexity of the push and pop operations in a queue implemented as an array?
Options: Pick one correct answer from below

O(n)

O(logN)

O(1)

O(NlogN)

4)Problem statement
How many children does a binary tree have?
Options: Pick one correct answer from below

2

any number of children

0 or 1 or 2 ---

0 or 1

5) Problem statement
What is the range of values that can be represented by the "byte" data type?

-128 to 255

-128 to 256

-128 to 127---

-127 to 128

6)Problem statement
Consider the string s = “acehlpwxzz”. What is the time complexity of searching any character in the given string?

Linear

Logarithmic

Constant

None of these
Solution description
For the given sorted string s = "acehlpwxzz", the time complexity of searching for any character is O(logn), where n is the length of the string.
This is because you can use binary search, which is efficient for sorted data. Binary search divides the search interval in half each time, resulting in a logarithmic time complexity.

7)Which operation is not supported by a binary search tree (BST)?

Insertion

Deletion

Searching

Random Access

Which of the following is correct statement for stack in DSA?

A   Stack Operations will be performed Smoothly
B   Underflow Occures
C   Overflow Occures
D   None of these
